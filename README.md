# Pentago (Python Version)
## Overview
This is the prototype version for a machine learning program to play Pentago. Machine learning does not always need to be composed of neural networks; it can be a simple collection of previously made decicions with the foresight of potetial outcomes. In the first iteration of this program we attempt to replicate a seasoned player's experience as it applies to Pentago.
## What is pentago?
Petago is a boardgame played on a 6x6 grid subdivided into four 3x3 quadrants. Players alternate playing their respective marbles into vacant slots and rotating any quadrant 90Â° clockwise or counterclockwise, thus concluding his or her turn. A player who achieves five in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) at the conclusion of the turn wins the game. This is currently a working progress.
